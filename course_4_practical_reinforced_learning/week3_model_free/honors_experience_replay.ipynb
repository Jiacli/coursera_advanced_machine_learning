If you're feeling that you need more examples to understand how experience replay works, try using it for binarized state spaces (CartPole or other __[classic control envs](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control)__).\n",

    "However, __the code you've written__ for this week is already capable of solving many RL problems, and as an added benifit - it is very easy to detach. You can use Q-learning, SARSA and Experience Replay for any RL problems you want to solve - just thow 'em into a file and import the stuff you need."
