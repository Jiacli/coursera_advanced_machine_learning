    "#### The borders removal (1.5 points)\n",
    "It is worth noting that there is a framing from all sides in most of the images. This framing can appreciably worsen the quality of channels alignment. Here, we suggest that you find the borders on the plates using Canny edge detector, and crop the images according to these edges. The example of using Canny detector implemented in skimage library can be found [here](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/edges/plot_canny.html).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The borders can be removed in the following way:\n",
    "* Apply Canny edge detector to the image.\n",
    "* Find the rows and columns of the frame pixels. \n",
    "For example, in case of upper bound we will search for the row in the neighborhood of the upper edge of the image (e.g. 5% of its height). For each row let us count the number of edge pixels (obtained using Canny detector) it contains. Having these number let us find two maximums among them. Two rows corresponding to these maximums are edge rows. As there are two color changes in the frame (firstly, from light scanner background to the dark tape and then from the tape to the image), we need the second maximum that is further from the image border. The row corresponding to this maximum is the crop border. In order not to find two neighboring peaks, non-maximum suppression should be implemented: the rows next to the first maximum are set to zero, and after that, the second maximum is searched for."

    "1. *Noise reduction.* To remove noise, the image is smoothed by Gaussian blur with the kernel of size $5 \\times 5$ and $\\sigma = 1.4$. Since the sum of the elements in the Gaussian kernel equals $1$, the kernel should be normalized before the convolution. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Calculating gradients.* When the image $I$ is smoothed, the derivatives $I_x$ and $I_y$ w.r.t. $x$ and $y$ are calculated. It can be implemented by convolving $I$ with Sobel kernels $K_x$ and $K_y$, respectively: \n",
    "$$ K_x = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 2 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, K_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & -2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}. $$ \n",

    "$$ \\theta(x,y) = arctan\\left(\\frac{I_y}{I_x}\\right)$$<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Non-maximum suppression.* For each pixel find two neighbors (in the positive and negative gradient directions, supposing that each neighbor occupies the angle of $\\pi /4$, and $0$ is the direction straight to the right). If the magnitude of the current pixel is greater than the magnitudes of the neighbors, nothing changes, otherwise, the magnitude of the current pixel is set to zero.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Double threshold.* The gradient magnitudes are compared with two specified threshold values, the first one is less than the second. The gradients that are smaller than the low threshold value are suppressed; the gradients higher than the high threshold value are marked as strong ones and the corresponding pixels are included in the final edge map. All the rest gradients are marked as weak ones and pixels corresponding to these gradients are considered in the next step.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Edge tracking by hysteresis.* Since a weak edge pixel caused from true edges will be connected to a strong edge pixel, pixel $w$ with weak gradient is marked as edge and included in the final edge map if and only if it is involved in the same blob (connected component) as some pixel $s$ with strong gradient. In other words, there should be a chain of neighbor weak pixels connecting $w$ and $s$ (the neighbors are 8 pixels around the considered one). You are welcome to make up and implement an algorithm that finds all the connected components of the gradient map considering each pixel only once.  After that, you can decide which pixels will be included in the final edge map (this algorithm should be single-pass, as well)."
